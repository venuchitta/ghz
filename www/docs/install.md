1. Download a prebuilt executable binary for your operating system from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/venuchitta/ghz/releases).
2. Unzip the archive and place the executable binary wherever you would like to run it from. Additionally consider adding the location directory in the `PATH` variable if you would like the `ghz` command to be available everywhere.

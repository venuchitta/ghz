`ghz` is a simple command line utility and [Go](http://golang.org/) package for load testing and benchmarking [gRPC](http://grpc.io) services. It is intended to be used for testing and debugging services locally, and in automated continous intergration environments for performance regression testing.

Additionally the core of the command line tool is implemented as a Go library package that can be used to programatically implement performance tests as well.
